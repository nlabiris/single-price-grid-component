## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Better usage of Flexbox.

### Continued development

Need to work more on absolute length units (i.e. px) and use relative ones more as well as media queries to manage responsiveness better.
